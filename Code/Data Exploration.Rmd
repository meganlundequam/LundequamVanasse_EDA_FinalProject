## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, census, fig.height=11}

# American Community Survey (ACS) has data on income, decennial does not

year = 2010

censusVariables = load_variables(year, "acs5", cache=TRUE)
View(censusVariables)

variables = c(
  "Median Family Income" = "B19113_001",
  "Total Population" = "B25026_001" # in occupied housing units
)

data = get_acs(geography = "state", # state, county, block, block group 
               year=year,
               variables = c(
                 variables["Median Family Income"],
                 variables["Total Population"])) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols="NAME", names_from="variable", values_from="estimate")
  
View(data)

ggplot(data, aes(x=`Median Family Income`, y=reorder(NAME, `Median Family Income`))) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x="Median Household Income", y="State")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
